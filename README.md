# AKO
my pain and suffering is recorded here

Basically every piece of masm code I wrote when studying CPU Architecture. It's disorganized and messy.

Most of the code is compiled on visual studio 2022 with masm selected as a dependency and called from C. Some of it is standalone assembly (still compiled on visual studio) and some of it is code made for DOS operating system.
The latter is very very buggy.
